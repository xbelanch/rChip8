rChip8
======

rChip8 is a chip8 emulator written in Ruby. Its goal is to explain how an emulator works... and, one year later I wrote it, I think it's very far from that goal... :(

If you're under GNU/Linux, it's easy to play with it:

1. Install the ruby-dev and sdl-dev libraries
2. Enter to sdl_lite/ and create the sdl lite binding (ruby extconf.rb && make)
3. Test if it's OK: ruby pong.rb
4. If you can see a strange game, perfect! You can now play with rChip8
5. ruby chip8 games/MAZE
6. Enjoy and fork it!
